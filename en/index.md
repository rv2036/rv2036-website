    title: "Mission"
    excerpt: "Jiachen Project aims to realize a mature RISC-V’s hardware and software ecosystem surpass to all other mainstream ISAs before 2036, the next year of Loong. This means mainstream-level maturity in applications such as datacenters, desktop computing, wearable technologies, and Internet of things - all implemented with systems of open ISA standards and open source system software stacks.<br/>The Mission is broken down into three core objectives for a zodiac cycle."
