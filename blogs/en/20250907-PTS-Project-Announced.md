# Itâ€™s time: The Jiachen Project has launched the construction of the RISC-V open source software Performance Tracking System (PTS)

(Automatically generated by Google Translate.)

The PTS is focusing on the performance evolution trend of the important global open source software RISC-V and publishing a roadmap; RISC-V manufacturers are sincerely invited to donate machines to participate in the construction

## Background, mission, and historical importance of PTS
The idea of the RISC-V open source software performance tracking system (PTS) was first born in 2020 [1]. At that time, Mr. Wu Wei, the leader of the Jiachen Project, as the co-chair of the Code Speed SIG of the RISC-V International Foundation, hoped to build a visual system similar to Mozilla's `AreWeFastYet.com` system to track the performance of various important open source software including JavaScript Engines on RISC-V chips and systems. At that time, the development of RISC-V IP and chips was still focused on the embedded field, and there were only a few models of development boards that could run the Linux desktop environment, such as SiFive Unmatched.

At the time, the PTS project was still quite advanced. The biggest concern was that prematurely disclosing the performance gap between RISC-V chips and Arm/X86 chips could have unintended negative consequences for the global RISC-V ecosystem.

A year after its establishment, the Code Speed SIG disbanded and reorganized for various reasons, and the PTS project has remained dormant until now. During this time, the PLCT Lab attempted to launch PTS several times in 2021 and 2023, but failed due to various resource constraints and layoffs.

On New Year's Eve 2024, the Jiachen Project launched, marking a turning point. After more than a year of development, over 50 companies have joined the Jiachen Project, gradually forming mutually supportive projects such as the "RISC-V Development Board Casual Drifting Project" and the "Open Source Internship Joint Recruitment and Training Program," rekindling the possibility of building a PTS. **The Jiachen Project has already secured sufficient venue sponsorship and operational support** (from Kuya Technology, Yingqi Intelligent, PLCT Laboratory, Hefei University of Technology, Dalian University of Technology, etc.), as well as a sufficient number of RISC-V development boards (including 200 LicheePi 4A TH1520 development boards donated by the Alibaba DAMO Academy's Xuantie team). The hardware and funding necessary for the initial phase of building the PTS are now in place.

The construction and operation of the PTS are crucial to the development of the global RISC-V ecosystem. RISC-V has already achieved widespread adoption in embedded systems and is expanding into high-performance computing and data center scenarios. The global open source software ecosystem already has considerable functional support for RISC-V. Going forward, the focus will be on identifying various optimization opportunities to increase speed. An automated performance evaluation system and the resulting performance database, which is easily queried and compared, will greatly facilitate developers in identifying performance regressions and identifying optimization opportunities.

The PTS will be hosted as an open source project under the Jiachen Project GitHub organization account. If all goes well, the data will be accessible via `pts.rv2036.org` starting October 1, 2025. All performance data collected by PTS will also be open source and hosted under the organization account `https://github.com/rv2036`.

## Tracked Open Source Software and Benchmark Scope

The following software is initially planned for monitoring. Software of interest to the RISC-V community will be added over time. Common performance benchmark suites include the SPEC CPU 20xx series and the CoreMark series. Different languages and execution environments have different test sets. By default, PTS will collect as many open source and free test sets as possible for tracking.
