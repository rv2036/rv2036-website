# Jiachen Project(甲辰计划) - RISC-V Prosperity 2036

## Background / 背景

Today, the RISC-V ecosystem has entered a phase of exponential growth. In the past 18 months, RISC-V has seen breakthrough in high performance server chips, desktop operating systems, mobile and wearable devices, AIoT, automotive systems, information security, and many other fields. In 2025, we expect to see the number of developers growing past a million and RISC-V super computers will enter the TOP500 list (with TOP10 projected for 2030).

With the development of computer architecture and foundational software platforms entering a “golden age” of rapid growth, open instruction set architectures such as RISC-V brought forth new scientific problems and engineering challenges. As leading contributors to the RISC-V ecosystem, we invite friends and experts around the globe to join us in this long-term collective effort to realize the goals of RISC-V Prosperity 2036.

RISC-V 生态正在进入前所未有的爆炸式增长的初期阶段。在过去的18个月中，RISC-V在高性能服务器芯片、桌面操作系统、移动及可穿戴设备、AIoT、车载系统及信息安全等领域都有了不平凡的突破。在2025年，RISC-V就将迎来预计超过100万名RISC-V应用开发者，与此同时RISC-V将在2025年进入世界超算TOP500、并在2030年进入TOP10。我们正处于一个计算机体系架构和基础软件系统的黄金时代，开放指令集架构带来了大量新的科学问题和工程挑战。作为全球领先的RISC-V生态贡献团队及个人，我们邀请志同道合者联合起来，以龙年为起点开启加速历程，为实现本计划的愿景和使命而并肩奋斗。

## Vision & Mission / 使命愿景

2024 is the year of the dragon, with 2036 coming up as the next.

RISC-V Prosperity 2036 aims to realize a mature RISC-V’s hardware and software ecosystem akin to that of the other mainstream architectures by the next year of the dragon, 2036. This means mainstream-level maturity in applications such as datacenters, desktop computing, wearable technologies, and Internet of things - all implemented with systems of open standards and open source system software stacks.

在下一个丙辰年（2036龙年）之前，基于 RISC-V 实现从数据中心到桌面办公、从移动穿戴到智能物联网全信息产业覆盖的开放标准体系及开源系统软件栈，使RISC-V软硬件生态的成熟度达到或超过其它主流架构的生态成熟度。

## Goals / 目标

1. Bringing a joint effort of over 100 chip and solutions manufacturers and over 500 software development firms, in order to port, optimize, and deploy over 1,000 key commercial software packages across 18 essential industries.
<br/>联合100家以上芯片及方案厂商、500家以上软件企业，在18个以上基础关键行业领域完成面向RISC-V的适配与优化，合作完成超过 1000 款重要行业及商业软件的移植与部署。
