excerpt: "We firmly believe that RISC-V will become the global open standard for ISAs. Support from the global software ecosystem will surpass all existing ISAs before 2036. <br/>If you share this vision, you are welcome to join the Jiachen Project.
<br/><br/>
我们坚信RISC-V会成为全球ISA的开放标准。全球所有的软件生态系统的支持将会在2036年之前超过所有现有ISA。<br/>如果你持有同样的观点，欢迎加入甲辰计划。"

    title: "Mission"
    excerpt: 'Jiachen Project aims to realize a mature RISC-V’s hardware and software ecosystem surpass to all other mainstream ISAs before 2036, the next year of Loong. This means mainstream-level maturity in applications such as datacenters, desktop computing, wearable technologies, and Internet of things - all implemented with systems of open ISA standards and open source system software stacks.<br/>The Mission is broken down into three core objectives for a zodiac cycle.'
